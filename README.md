## Description
A real estate web application designed to facilitate the buying, selling, and renting, of real estate properties. These applications offer a wide range of features and functionalities to streamline the entire real estate transaction process, making it more convenient and efficient for users. 

We identify four primary users: Homebuyers, Property renters,  system administrator(s), and (real-state) brokers. Homebuyers search for properties to buy.  They can request a visit to the broker managing the unit.  They have different criteria to search for properties, including filtering by price range; the number of rooms; living and lot area dimensions; time in the market; building type; year built, etc.  They can also search for brokers, or use a calculator to estimate the monthly payment of a property of their interest.  Property renters are individuals or families seeking rental accommodations.  They can use similar search criteria as homebuyers, and they can also request visits to a property.
The system administrator is responsible for adding/removing brokers.  The brokers manage their own property listings.  Brokers can also make purchase offers to properties listed by other brokers.
